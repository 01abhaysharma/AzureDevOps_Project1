# Step 5: Creating Repo in Azure DevOps project and Importing GitHub repository

1. In Azure DevOps, navigate to the project (Created in Step 4) where you want to create a new repo.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Repos".
3. In the repository page, click on the "Import" button located in center of page in "Import a repository" section.
4. In the import dialog box, select "Git" as the repository type and under clone URL paste the URL of GitHub repository that You want to import. (In this case Github repo will be sample dot net code repository that we created in Step 2).
5. You may need to authenticate to your GitHub account and authorize Azure DevOps to access your repositories.
6. Select the repository you want to import.
7. Click on "Import" to start the import process.
8. Wait for the import process to complete. Depending on the size of your codebase, this may take a few minutes or longer.

That's it! Your GitHub repository is now imported into Azure DevOps Project Repo, and you can start using it in your Azure DevOps pipelines.

# Step 6: Creating a new Service Connection in Azure DevOps

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and click on "Project settings" in the bottom left corner.
2. In the Project Settings menu, click on "Service connections" under "Pipelines".
3. Click on the "+ New service connection" button in the top right corner and select the service you want to connect to. For this project, select "Azure Resource Manager" as the type of service connection.
4. Select the scope type as "Subscription". A new window will open for authentication to authenticate with Azure.
5. Once authenticated, select the resource group, provide a name for the service connection, and check "Grant access to all pipelines". Then click on "Save".

That's it! Your service connection is now created. After creating the service connection, you can use it in your pipeline YAML file to deploy your application to the connected environment.

# Step 7: Creating Azure DevOps Pipeline to Build and Deploy code to App service

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and click on "Pipelines" in the left sidebar.
2. Click on "New pipeline" to create a new pipeline.
3. Choose the source of your code. Select "Azure Repos Git" and choose your repository and branch.
4. Choose a pipeline template to start with. Select the "Starter pipeline" template.
5. In the "Configure your pipeline" step, choose the build agent pool you want to use. The default agent pool should work fine for this project.
6. In the "Review your pipeline YAML" step, review the pipeline YAML file and make any necessary modifications. Below is an example YAML file for this project:

## YAML file used for this project:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.0.x'
    includePreviewVersions: true

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
    projects: '**/*Tests.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'publish'
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'package'
    pathToPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    publishLocation: 'Container'

- task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'package'
    downloadPath: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)'

- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<service connection name>'
    appName: '<app service name>'
    package: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/package/**/*.zip'

```
7. Click on "Save and run" to save the pipeline and trigger the pipeline.
8. Once pipeline is completed successfully, navigate to Your App service in Azure portal and click on default domain URL in overview section and see Your code is deployed to this App service.

## YAML file task details:

- UseDotNet task (`UseDotNet@2`) - This installs the .NET Core SDK and runtime needed to build and run the application (if it's not already installed).
- DotNetCoreCLI task (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) (`build`) - This builds the application. It compiles the .NET Core application code into an executable form.
- DotNetCoreCLI task (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) (`test`) - This task runs the unit tests in the .NET Core application. 
- DotNetCoreCLI task (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) (`publish`) - This publishes the application to a specified output directory. 
- PublishBuildArtifacts task (`PublishBuildArtifacts@1`) - This publishes the contents of the output directory as a build artifact. This task publishes the build artifacts to the artifact staging directory, which is a temporary location on the build agent. The artifacts can then be downloaded by other tasks and used in subsequent stages.
- DownloadBuildArtifacts task (`DownloadBuildArtifacts@0`) - This downloads the build artifact to a specified directory. This task downloads the build artifacts from the artifact staging directory. It is used in subsequent stages to deploy the application.
- AzureWebApp task (`AzureWebApp@1`) (`deploy`) - This deploys the contents of the build artifact to an Azure Web App. This task deploys the .NET Core application to an Azure Web App service. It requires an Azure subscription and a connection to the Azure Web App service.
